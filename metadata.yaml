description: The story of the four Beverly children, in the days of the English Civil
  War, following the defeat of Charles I. After their Royalist father is killed fighting
  in the war, the children are forced to hide away from their father's enemies, the
  Roundhead soldiers, when their home is burned down. They are taken to a cottage
  in the New Forest and disguised as the grandchildren of a poor forester, a gamekeeper
  named Jacob. The children must learn to adapt from an aristocratic lifestyle to
  that of simple forest cottagers.
